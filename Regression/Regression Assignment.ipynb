    "Multicollinearity is a phenomenon that occurs in multiple linear regression when two or more independent variables in the model are highly correlated with each other. This can cause problems in the regression analysis because it makes it difficult to distinguish the individual effect of each independent variable on the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",

    "To detect multicollinearity, you can calculate the correlation matrix between the independent variables in the model. If the correlation coefficient between two or more independent variables is high (usually greater than 0.7 or 0.8), then there is a high degree of multicollinearity in the model.\n",

    "Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Another technique to address multicollinearity is to use PCA to transform the correlated independent variables into a new set of uncorrelated variables called principal components. These principal components can then be used as the independent variables in the regression model.\n",

    ".A polynomial regression model is a type of regression analysis that allows for the relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable to be modeled as an nth degree polynomial function. This type of model is an extension of linear regression, which assumes a linear relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In polynomial regression, the independent variable is raised to a power (degree) greater than one and is included as a predictor variable in the model. This allows for the model to fit more complex relationships between the independent and dependent variables that cannot be captured by a linear regression model. For example, a quadratic function has a parabolic curve shape, which can be modeled by a second-degree polynomial regression model.\n",

In polynomial regression, the interpretation of the coefficients is more complex and depends on the degree of the polynomial.\n",
